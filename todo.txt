Multithread the chunks

more chunks didnt do that much past 50 


idk why the y height bounds enforcing isnt working

when particles collide going in the same direction, it doesnt really work 
same y direction *
or different y direction?1
  THE DIRECTIONS : 
    want the inverse sign of their EXISITNG DIRECTIONS
    where they  exchange the other particles magniturde
    they copy the other particles magniturde
    then inverse that magnitude
